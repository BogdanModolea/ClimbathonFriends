# A little API Website

This project was inspired by Climbathon 2023 (https://climbathon.gg/) and was created for me and some friends that play League of Legends.

## How does it work?

Every 24h Riot Games allows people to generate an API that can be used in order to get datas for any user in any of their games. With that in mind and by following some Twitch streamers that competed in the challenge, I decided to create a similar page that can track me and my friends while playing League of Legends.

## What have I learnt?

Combining learning and relaxing, I managed to gain knowledge about React, APIs and more about JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
